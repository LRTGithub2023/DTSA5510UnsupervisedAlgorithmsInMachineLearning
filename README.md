Welcome! And thank you for taking the time to read and grade my work.

This delivereable is split in the following parts:
1) a html report, which you can find in this repository.
2) the code.

The code is embedded in a Jupyter Notebook. It has 2 sections:
1) source the data from yahoo finance. The data set is very large.
Save the notebook in your chosen directory.
Create a subdirectory "data".
Run the notebook file. The data will be saved in 'data'.
2) Save this file in 'data': sp500ListWiki.csv
3) Process and model the data.
4) Final results.

You may need to delete saved files if you decide to run this piece of code more than once.
